# Change Your Password for a MySQL user

### Connect to MySQL using the MySQL command-line client. You can do this by opening a terminal and entering the following command.
```
mysql -u ashadozzaman -p
```
Replace `ashadozzaman` with your MySQL username. You will be prompted to enter your current MySQL password.

### Once you are logged in, you can use the following command to change your password
```
ALTER USER 'ashadozzaman'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
```
Replace the following:
- ashadozzaman: Your MySQL username.
- localhost: Your MySQL host (e.g., 'localhost').
- new_password: Your new MySQL password.

For example:
```
ALTER USER 'ashadozzaman'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_secure_password';
```
### After changing the password, you need to flush privileges for the changes to take effect.
```
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
### Exit the MySQL command-line client.
```
\q
```
Remember to update your applications or scripts with the new password wherever it is being used to connect to MySQL.

Please note that you must have sufficient privileges to alter your own user account. If you encounter any issues, ensure that you are using an account with the necessary privileges or contact your database administrator for assistance.
