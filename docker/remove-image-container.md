## To remove all Docker images from your system
You can use the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
```
# Stop all running containers
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)

# Remove single containers
docker rm abc(id)

# Remove all containers
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

# Remove single images
docker rmi id

# Remove all images
docker rmi $(docker images -aq)
```
Please note that these commands will forcefully stop and remove all running containers and delete all images. Make sure you don't have any important data or containers that you want to keep before executing these commands.

If you encounter any errors related to containers being in use, you may need to stop and remove them individually before attempting to remove the images again.
