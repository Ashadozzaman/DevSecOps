## Jenkins Parallel Pipeline
A Jenkins parallel pipeline allows you to run multiple stages or steps concurrently. Here's a basic example of how you can create a parallel pipeline in Jenkins using the declarative syntax.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Parallel Stage') {
            parallel {
                stage('Stage 1') {
                    steps {
                        echo 'Running Stage 1'
                        // Add your steps for Stage 1 here
                    }
                }
                stage('Stage 2') {
                    steps {
                        echo 'Running Stage 2'
                    }
                }
                stage('Stage 3') {
                    steps {
                        echo 'Running Stage 3'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Final Stage') {
            steps {
                script{
                    parallel{
                        steps {
                            echo 'Running Stage 2'
                        },
                        'Step 1' : {
                            echo "1"
                        },
                        'Step 2' : {
                            echo "2"
                        }
                    }
                }
                echo 'Running Final Stage'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **pipeline**: Defines the entire Jenkins pipeline.
2. **agent any**: Specifies that the pipeline can run on any available agent.
3. **stages**: Defines the different stages of the pipeline.
4. **stage('Parallel Stage')**: A stage that contains parallel stages.
5. **parallel**: Keyword to indicate that the following stages will run in parallel.
6. **stage('Stage 1')**, **stage('Stage 2')**, **stage('Stage 3')**: Individual stages that will run in parallel.
7. **steps**: Contains the steps to be executed within each stage.
8. **echo 'Running Stage X'**: Prints a message to the console.

You can customize the steps within each stage as needed for your build process. The `Final Stage` runs after all parallel stages have completed.
