## Continuous Integration (CI)

### Why need Continuous Integration (CI)

**Scenario:** `Manually Code Integration, Manual Testing, Manual Building`

**Solution => Continuous Integration:**
Continuous Integration (CI) is crucial in modern software development for several reasons:

1. **Reduced Integration Issues**: With manual integration, developers may work on separate parts of the codebase for extended periods before combining their changes. This can lead to integration conflicts, where different parts of the codebase are incompatible. CI ensures that changes are integrated frequently, reducing the likelihood of conflicts.

2. **Faster Feedback Loop**: Manual testing and building processes can be time-consuming. CI automates these processes, allowing for rapid feedback on code changes. Developers receive immediate notifications if their changes break the build or cause tests to fail, enabling them to fix issues quickly.

3. **Increased Quality**: Automated testing as part of CI ensures that each code change is thoroughly tested. This leads to higher software quality as bugs are caught early in the development process, reducing the likelihood of issues in production.

4. **Improved Collaboration**: CI encourages collaboration among team members by providing a central platform for integrating changes and running tests. Developers can easily see the status of the build and test results, facilitating communication and coordination within the team.

5. **Streamlined Deployment**: CI pipelines can be extended to include deployment processes, leading to Continuous Deployment (CD). This means that code changes are not only tested but also automatically deployed to production environments if they pass all tests. This streamlines the deployment process and allows for faster delivery of features to end-users.

6. **Version Control Integration**: CI tools are often integrated with version control systems like Git, allowing for seamless integration of code changes into the CI pipeline. This ensures that changes are tracked, and it's easy to revert to previous versions if needed.

7. **Scalability and Consistency**: CI enables scalability by automating repetitive tasks like building and testing. It ensures consistency across environments, as the same automated processes are applied consistently to each code change.

Overall, Continuous Integration improves the efficiency, quality, and collaboration within development teams, leading to faster delivery of high-quality software.

### Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
**Continuous Delivery:** `Deployment Triggered manually`

Continuous Delivery is a practice where software is built, tested, and prepared for release in an automated fashion. However, the actual deployment to production is triggered manually. In other words, while the entire process from code commit to build, test, and package creation is automated, the decision to release the software to production is made by a human.

**Continuous Deployment:** `Deployment Triggered Automatically`

Continuous Deployment takes automation a step further by automatically deploying every code change that passes through the CI pipeline directly to production. Unlike Continuous Delivery, where deployment to production is manual, in Continuous Deployment, it's automatic.
