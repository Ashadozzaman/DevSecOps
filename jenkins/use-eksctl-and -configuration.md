To use `eksctl` on your Windows system, you need to install it first. Follow these steps to install and activate `eksctl`:

### Step 1: Download `eksctl`

1. **Download the `eksctl` executable:**
   - Go to the [official `eksctl` releases page](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases).
   - Find the latest release and download the Windows executable (`eksctl_<version>_windows_amd64.zip`).

2. **Extract the `eksctl` executable:**
   - Extract the contents of the downloaded `.zip` file to a directory of your choice, e.g., `C:\eksctl`.

### Step 2: Add `eksctl` to PATH

1. **Add the directory to your system's PATH environment variable:**
   - Open the Start Menu, search for "Environment Variables", and select "Edit the system environment variables".
   - In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables..." button.
   - In the Environment Variables window, under "System variables", find and select the `Path` variable, then click "Edit...".
   - Click "New" and add the path to the directory where you extracted the `eksctl` executable (e.g., `C:\eksctl\`).
**Note:** Add `eksctl.exe` file location here

2. **Verify the addition:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window and type the following command:

     ```sh
     eksctl version
     ```

   - You should see the version information for `eksctl` if it is installed and added to your PATH correctly.

### Step 3: Configure `eksctl`

Ensure that your AWS CLI is configured correctly since `eksctl` relies on your AWS credentials. You can verify your AWS configuration by running:

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

This should return details about your IAM user if everything is set up correctly.

### Using `eksctl`

Now you can use `eksctl` commands to manage your Amazon EKS clusters. For example:

```sh
eksctl create cluster --name my-cluster --region us-west-2
```

This command will create a new EKS cluster named `my-cluster` in the `us-west-2` region.
